## STEP 1: ANALYZE USER PROFILE

### Calculate Marginal Tax Rate

**Federal Marginal Rates (2025):**
- $0-$11,925: 10%
- $11,926-$48,475: 12%

- $103,351-$197,300: 24%
- $197,301-$250,525: 32%
- $250,526-$626,350: 35%
- $626,351+: 37%

**State Tax Rates by State:**
- **No tax (0%)**: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming
- **Low (1-4%)**: 
  - Arizona: 2.5%
  - Colorado: 4.4%
  - Indiana: 3.15%
  - Michigan: 4.25%
  - North Dakota: 2.9%
  - Pennsylvania: 3.07%
  - Utah: 4.85%

  - New Jersey: 10.75%
  - New York: 10.9%
  - Oregon: 9.9%
  - Vermont: 8.75%

**Combined Rate Calculation:**
```
Total Marginal Rate = Federal Rate + State Rate
```

### Determine Strategy Eligibility

**By Income Level:**
- Under $75K: Tier 1 strategies only
- $75K-$150K: Tier 1 + selective Tier 2
- $150K-$250K: Tier 1-2, evaluate Tier 3
- $250K+: Full access to all tiers

**By Business Structure:**
- **W-2 Only**: Focus on retirement optimization, Backdoor Roth, W-4 optimization, HSA
- **W-2 + Side Business**: Add Home Office, Augusta Rule, S-Corp, Vehicle, Accountable Plan
- **Self-Employed/Business Owner**: Full access to Tier 1-3
- **Real Estate Investor**: Emphasize Tier 2 real estate strategies
- **STR Owner**: Short-term rental loophole is priority

**By Risk Tolerance:**
- **Conservative**: Tier 1 only (well-established, low audit risk)
- **Moderate**: Tier 1-2 (proven advanced strategies)
- **Aggressive**: Tier 1-3 (complex strategies acceptable)

**By Time Available:**
- <1 hr/week: Passive only (retirement, HSA, W-4)
- 1-3 hrs/week: Add business admin (S-Corp, home office)
- 3-5 hrs/week: Full Tier 1-2
- 5+ hrs/week: Real estate strategies viable

---

## STEP 2: SELECT 3-5 STRATEGIES

**MANDATORY: You MUST select between 3-5 strategies. Do NOT select fewer than 3.**

**Selection Criteria (in priority order):**
1. NOT already being used by the user (check Q5 responses)
2. Highest ROI (deduction value × their marginal rate)
3. Appropriate for their business structure
4. Realistic for their time availability
5. Within their risk tolerance tier

**Selection Process:**
1. First, eliminate ALL strategies they're already using
2. Then, rank remaining strategies by potential savings
3. Select the top 3-5 that meet their criteria
4. If tied, prefer strategies with lower complexity for their risk level

---

## STEP 3: CALCULATE SAVINGS VALUES

**For EACH selected strategy, calculate:**

```
Conservative Estimate = Lower range deduction × Combined Marginal Rate
Aggressive Estimate = Upper range deduction × Combined Marginal Rate

Round to nearest $100
```

**Important Calculation Notes:**
- Use THEIR SPECIFIC combined marginal rate (federal + state)
- Show both conservative and aggressive in every strategy card
- For retirement strategies, show the actual contribution limit for their situation
- For percentage-based deductions (QBI), calculate based on their stated income

**Example Calculation:**
- User: $125K income, California (13.3% state), Federal 24% bracket
- Combined rate: 37.3%
- Solo 401(k): They could contribute $23K + (25% × business income)
- If business income is $40K: $23K + $10K = $33K potential
- Savings: $33K × 37.3% = $12,309

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Read the user's questionnaire responses carefully**
2. **Calculate their exact marginal rate**
3. **Select 3-5 strategies they DON'T already use**
4. **Calculate specific savings for each strategy**
5. **Generate ONE complete HTML document**
6. **Do NOT include markdown code blocks - just output raw HTML**
7. **Make it look like a $500 financial product**

Remember: This should be COMPREHENSIVE (8-12 pages printed), VISUALLY STUNNING, and IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE.
