## Your Task
Generate a complete HTML document (a tax strategy report) that looks like a premium financial product. Think modern SaaS dashboard meets professional financial report.

## Step 1: Analyze the User Profile

### Calculate Marginal Tax Rate

**Federal Marginal Rates (2025):**
- $75K-$150K income: 22-24%
- $150K-$250K: 24-32%
- $250K-$400K: 32-35%
- $400K-$750K: 35-37%
- $750K+: 37%

**State Tax Rates:**
- No tax (0%): Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming
- Low (1-4%): Arizona (2.5%), Colorado (4.4%), Indiana (3.15%), Michigan (4.25%), North Dakota (2.9%), Pennsylvania (3.07%), Utah (4.85%)
- Medium (4-7%): Georgia (5.49%), Illinois (4.95%), Kentucky (4.5%), Massachusetts (5%), North Carolina (4.75%), Ohio (3.99%), Oklahoma (4.75%), Virginia (5.75%)
- High (7%+): California (13.3%), Hawaii (11%), Minnesota (9.85%), New Jersey (10.75%), New York (10.9%), Oregon (9.9%), Vermont (8.75%)

**Combined Rate = Federal + State**

### Determine Strategy Tier Access

**By Income:**
- <$75K: Tier 1 only
- $75K-$150K: Tier 1 + selective Tier 2
- $150K-$250K: Tier 1-2, evaluate Tier 3
- $250K+: Full access

**By Business Structure:**
- W-2 Only: Retirement (Solo 401k if side income), Backdoor Roth, W-4 optimization, HSA
- W-2 + Side Business: Add Home Office, Augusta Rule, S-Corp, Vehicle, Accountable Plan
- Self-Employed/Business Owner: Full Tier 1-3 access
- Real Estate Investor: Emphasize Tier 2 real estate strategies

**By Risk Tolerance:**
- Conservative: Tier 1 only (well-established, low audit risk)
- Moderate: Tier 1-2 (add proven advanced strategies)
- Aggressive: Tier 1-3 (complex strategies acceptable)

**By Time Available:**
- <1 hr/week: Passive strategies only (retirement, HSA, W-4)
- 1-3 hrs: Add business admin (S-Corp, home office)
- 3-5 hrs: Full Tier 1-2 access
- 5+ hrs: Real estate strategies viable

## Step 2: Select 3-5 Strategies

Choose strategies based on:
1. Highest ROI (value × marginal rate)
2. NOT already being used (check their current strategies)
3. Appropriate for their business structure
4. Realistic for their time availability
5. Within their risk tolerance

### Strategy Reference

**TIER 1 - FOUNDATIONAL:**

1. **Solo 401(k) / Retirement Maximization**
   - Requirements: Self-employment income
   - Value: $7,000-$69,000 contribution = $2,100-$25,500 savings at 30% rate
   - 2025 Limits: $23,000 employee + 25% employer (total $69,000; $76,500 if 50+)

2. **Backdoor Roth IRA**
   - Requirements: Income above Roth limits ($161K single, $240K married)
   - Value: $7,000/year tax-free growth ($8,000 if 50+)
   - Process: Non-deductible Traditional IRA → convert to Roth

3. **S-Corporation Election**
   - Requirements: $60,000+ net self-employment profit
   - Value: Save 15.3% SE tax on distributions above reasonable salary
   - Example: $150K profit, $70K salary = ~$12,000 saved

4. **Home Office Deduction**
   - Requirements: Dedicated home space for business
   - Value: $1,500 (simplified) to $5,000+ (regular method)
   - Method: $5/sq ft (max 300) OR actual expenses × business %

5. **Augusta Rule (Section 280A)**
   - Requirements: Own home + have a business
   - Value: Rent home to business for up to 14 days tax-free
   - Typical: $350-$1,000/day × 14 days = $5,000-$14,000

6. **HSA Maximization**
   - Requirements: High-deductible health plan
   - Value: Triple tax advantage on $4,150 (self) / $8,300 (family)
   - 2025 catch-up: Additional $1,000 if 55+

7. **W-4 Optimization**
   - Requirements: W-2 employment
   - Value: Improve cash flow by $200-$800/month
   - Method: Adjust withholdings to minimize refund/payment

8. **Accountable Plan**
   - Requirements: Business with employees (including spouse)
   - Value: $2,000-$5,000+ per employee in deductible reimbursements
   - Covers: Mileage, cell, internet, home office, supplies

9. **Vehicle Expense Optimization**
   - Requirements: Business vehicle use >50%
   - Value: $2,000-$15,000 depending on method
   - Options: Standard mileage (70¢/mile 2025) OR actual + depreciation

**TIER 2 - REAL ESTATE:**

10. **Cost Segregation Study**
    - Requirements: Own investment/business property
    - Value: Accelerate $50,000-$500,000 in depreciation
    - Bonus: 100% bonus depreciation now PERMANENT (OBBBA 2025)

11. **Short-Term Rental Loophole**
    - Requirements: Own/lease STR with avg stay <7 days
    - Value: Losses offset W-2 income (unlike regular rentals)
    - Key: Must materially participate (100+ hours, more than anyone)

12. **Real Estate Professional Status**
    - Requirements: 750+ hours in real estate activities
    - Value: All rental losses become non-passive
    - Great for: Spouse available full-time for RE activities

**TIER 3 - BUSINESS:**

13. **QBI Deduction (199A)**
    - Requirements: Pass-through business income
    - Value: 20% deduction on qualified business income
    - Made PERMANENT by OBBBA 2025

14. **Multiple Entity Structure**
    - Requirements: Multiple income streams or business lines
    - Value: Optimize QBI, protect assets, reduce SE tax
    - Example: Management company paying family members

## Step 3: Calculate Values

For each strategy:
```
Annual Tax Savings = Deduction × Combined Marginal Rate

Conservative estimate: Use lower deduction amount
Aggressive estimate: Use higher deduction amount
```

## Step 4: Generate the HTML Report

Create a complete, standalone HTML document with embedded CSS using modern design principles.

### DESIGN SYSTEM

**Colors:**
- Primary: #2563eb (blue-600) - main actions, headings
- Success: #10b981 (emerald-500) - savings, positive metrics
- Background: #f8fafc (slate-50) - page background
- Card: #ffffff - content cards
- Text: #0f172a (slate-900) - body text
- Text Secondary: #64748b (slate-500) - supporting text
- Border: #e2e8f0 (slate-200) - dividers
- Accent Orange: #f59e0b (amber-500) - highlights, warnings
- Gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)

**Typography:**
- Headings: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif
- Large numbers: Use 48px+ for key metrics
- Body: 16px, line-height 1.6
- Small print: 14px

**Spacing:**
- Generous whitespace between sections (40-60px)
- Card padding: 32px
- Section padding: 60px vertical

**Components to use:**
- Cards with subtle shadows (0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
- Pill badges for difficulty/tier
- Progress bars for visual metrics
- Icon-like emoji or symbols for visual interest
- Gradient backgrounds for hero sections
- Timeline visualization for action plans

### Page 1: Tax Snapshot & Executive Summary

**Section 1: Tax Snapshot (New Personalized Summary)**
Create a premium summary card at the very top:
- Title: "Your Tax Snapshot"
- User's first name prominently displayed
- Income: Show EXACT amount (e.g., "$125,000")
- Filing status and state
- Income type badges based on Q3 selections (W-2, 1099/Contractor, Business Owner, Real Estate, Investor, STR)
- Time available from Q9 (e.g., "3-5 hours/week")
- Comfort level from Q10 (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
- Primary goal from Q11

**Section 2: Assumptions Dropdown (Collapsed by Default)**
- One short section explaining:
  - Savings are estimates based on inputs
  - Final numbers depend on eligibility, CPA filing choices, and current year limits
  - Make it collapsible/expandable with a chevron

**Section 3: Scoreboard (Replace "What You're Missing")**
Title: "Where you are now vs what you could unlock"
Two-column layout:
- Left: "Already doing" (from Q5 strategies with checkmarks ✓)
- Right: "High impact opportunities" (the 3 strategies we will reveal)
- Use visual comparison with progress indicators

**Section 4: Executive Summary (Hero Section)**
Create an eye-catching hero with:
- Gradient background header
- HUGE number showing total savings potential (72px font)
- Visual savings range bar or graphic
- Preview cards for top 3 strategies (each as a mini card with icon, name, and savings)
- Generated date stamp

**Section 5: CTA #1 (Top of Report)**
Primary CTA button:
- Button text: "Book a Tax Savings Review Call"
- Subtext: "15 minutes. We confirm eligibility, tighten your savings estimate, and map your next 90 days."
- Include "What you get on the call" box:
  * Confirm which strategies you actually qualify for
  * Identify the biggest missed levers (without guessing)
  * Give a simple 90-day roadmap
  * If it makes sense, we can help implement
- Add friction reducers: "No obligation", "If you already have a CPA, great. We coordinate."

### Page 2: Tax Profile Dashboard

Present as a dashboard with cards:
- **Profile Card**: Income, filing status, state, business type in a grid
- **Tax Rate Breakdown Card**: Visual breakdown of federal + state with percentages
  - Use progress bars or horizontal bars to show rates
  - Big callout: "Every $1,000 saved = $XXX in your pocket"
- **Gap Analysis Card**: What you're currently using vs. what you're missing
  - Use checkmarks ✓ for what they have
  - Use highlight/warning color for gaps
  - Bullet points, not paragraphs

### Page 3-4: Strategy Cards (Your Recommended Strategies)

Each strategy should be a beautifully designed card:

## CSS REQUIREMENTS

Include these modern CSS features:
```css
/* Modern reset and base */
* { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }
body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #0f172a;
  background: #f8fafc;
}

/* Cards with depth */
.card {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  padding: 32px;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
}

/* Visual hierarchy */
.stat-large {
  font-size: 48px;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: #10b981;
  line-height: 1;
}

/* Progress bars */
.progress-bar {
  height: 8px;
  background: #e2e8f0;
  border-radius: 999px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Badges and pills */
.badge {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 4px 12px;
  border-radius: 999px;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 500;
}

/* Print optimization */
@media print {
  .card { page-break-inside: avoid; }
  body { background: white; }
}
```

## Output Rules

1. Output ONLY the complete HTML document
2. Do not include any explanation before or after the HTML
3. Do not use markdown code blocks - just raw HTML
4. Include all CSS inline in a <style> tag
5. Make it print-friendly with appropriate page breaks
6. Use modern, clean design that looks professional
7. Include actual calculated numbers, not placeholders
8. Make savings numbers VERY prominent and easy to spot
9. Use visual indicators (progress bars, colored badges, icons)
10. Create clear visual hierarchy - most important info should be largest
11. Include whitespace - don't cram everything together
12. Make it scannable - users should grasp key info in 10 seconds
13. Include the disclaimer but make it look professional

## Important Constraints

- NEVER recommend a strategy they already use
- NEVER recommend strategies above their stated risk tolerance
- NEVER recommend time-intensive strategies for users with <5 hrs/week
- ALWAYS show both conservative and aggressive savings estimates
- ALWAYS calculate using THEIR specific marginal rate
- ALWAYS include specific action items with names, phone numbers, URLs
- LIMIT to 3-5 strategies maximum (focus on highest impact)
- MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL - this should look like a $500 financial product

## Personalization Requirements

Every "Why it fits you" section must:
- Reference their specific income/business structure/situation
- Explain the specific benefit in dollar terms when possible
- Feel personally written, not template language
- Be 2-3 sentences maximum

Every "Quick Start" must:
- Be actionable THIS WEEK
- Include specific company names, phone numbers, or URLs
- Be one concrete action, not multiple steps
- Take less than 1 hour to complete

## Copy Guidelines (IMPORTANT)

- NO "IRS-approved" phrasing. Use "permitted under current tax rules" or "commonly used and well-documented"
- Use first name HEAVILY throughout report and CTA sections
- Keep "Quick Start" steps short. 3 steps MAX
- Add "Mistakes to avoid" on EVERY strategy. This increases value without giving away the farm
- Focus on personalization with exact income amounts (e.g., "With your $125,000 income...")
- Reference their specific situation in every "Why it fits you" section

## Quality Checklist

Before outputting, verify:
- ✓ All numbers are calculated, not placeholders
- ✓ Savings use their actual marginal rate
- ✓ No strategies they already use are recommended
- ✓ Design uses cards, proper spacing, and visual hierarchy
- ✓ Key metrics (total savings) are huge and prominent
- ✓ Each strategy has difficulty indicator and colored accent
- ✓ Timeline is visual, not just a text list
- ✓ Profile section shows their specific situation
- ✓ Gap analysis is specific to what they're missing
- ✓ CTA is clear and compelling
- ✓ Disclaimer is present but not intrusive
- ✓ Print styles are included
- ✓ Tax Snapshot shows exact income amount
- ✓ Scoreboard shows "Already doing" vs "Opportunities"
- ✓ Hidden Opportunities section is included (no how-to)
- ✓ All 3 CTA placements are present
- ✓ Copy guidelines are followed (no "IRS-approved", use first name, etc.)`;
